# ArcadeGPU: Flight Simulator

**ELI10 TLDR:** Fly your airplane, maneuver with your mouse and keyboard, and soar through a 3D sky.

A high-performance 3D Flight Simulator Game built with the **ArcadeGPU** engine. This project features real-time Jolt Physics, custom 3D procedural meshes, and a nostalgic arcade aesthetic.

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls
*   **W / S** - Pitch
*   **A / D** - Roll
*   **Q / E** - Yaw
*   **SHIFT / CTRL** - Throttle (Speed up / Slow down)
*   **MOUSE** - Pitch / Roll via steering
*   **Virtual Joystick / Buttons** - On-screen controls for mobile players

## 🛠 Developer Handoff Guide

### Key Systems

1.  **Input Handling**: Centralized in `inputManager`. Actions are registered in `GameScreen.onEnter()`. Pointer event propagation is explicitly stopped for touch UI buttons to prevent unintended camera movement while flying.
2.  **Flight Physics**: Simulating roll, pitch, yaw, and throttle mapped into forward vectors via Jolt Physics with gravity-based flight dynamics.
3.  **Entity Lifecycle**:
    -   `constructor()`: Setup physics bodies and procedural meshes.
    -   `update(ts)`: Handle flight logic, move physics bodies, and sync mesh positions.
    -   `draw()`: Submit meshes to the `gfx3MeshRenderer`.

## ⚙️ Build and Run

1.  Ensure all dependencies are installed via `npm install`.
2.  Run the development server with `npm run dev`.
3.  Navigate to `localhost:3000` to play.
